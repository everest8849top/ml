# Foundations of Machine Learning Course Materials.

This is the repository of my course in **Foundations of Machine Learning** (EE 298M/CoE 197M). Similar to my previous course in [Deep Learning](https://github.com/roatienza/Deep-Learning-Experiments), I would like to strike a balance between theory and practical implementation of concepts. The course materials are still under development. Please expect occasional errors, missing parts, bugs, etc. Apologies in advance.

With some modifications, the theory part is based on Mathematics for Machine Learning book. It is freely available at this [link](https://mml-book.github.io/). 

**Thank you!** I greatly appreciate the authors for having the book available online. This is helpful for students who have limited resources. 

As much as possible, code examples are written to better understand key concepts. The code examples in this course are in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). I tried using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) but encountered errors in saving my notebooks. So, I switched to Jupyter Notebook. In theory, you can upload the notebooks here to Google Colab. 

## Roadmap
1. **Linear Algebra** - Tensors, Operations, Basis, Rank, Spaces/Subspaces, Groups, Linear Mappings
   - [Lecture Notes](https://github.com/roatienza/ml/blob/master/linear_algebra/Linear_Algebra.pdf)
   - [Code](https://github.com/roatienza/ml/blob/master/linear_algebra/notebook/numpy_intro.ipynb)
2. **Analytic Geometry** 
3. **Matrix Decomposition**
4. **Vector Calculus**
5. **Probability Distributions**
6. **Expectation Maximization (EM) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)**
7. **Optimization**
8. **Regression**
9. **Gaussian Mixture Models**
10. **Support Vector Machines**
